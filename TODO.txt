- Implement dummy hasher(s), dummy credential(s) and dummy source(s).
  - Done: all here.
- Test EVERYTHING (this one will be quite large) by creating tests/.
  - Done: login, password change tests, multi hasher and auth requirements.
- Move the default implementations of hashers and sources to other side (new packages).
  - Done: removed them. They will exist in a different package.
- Update the README.md file.
